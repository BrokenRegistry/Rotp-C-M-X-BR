Now working on:
- WYSIWYG test.

April Updates:
- New WYSIWYG option: The final galaxy will be the preview one. With controlled randomness.
  - Applied to all Galaxies.
  - Change the source number to change the galaxy.
    - 0 => random. (as before)
- Totally removed Profiles Manager (Was no more maintained -> Danger)
- Xilmi AI: Improved reaction to missile attacks.
- Right click on alert to center the map on the system.
- Governor: Added an option to not infiltrate nor spy the xenophobic races.
- Renamed "Target Bombing" to "Limited Bombing" and adjusted the GUI texts.
  - in Option GUI and on the buttons: "Drop All" "Spare x pop" "No".
- Custom Races:
  - Added Preferred Chip Set. (With pop-up list for selection)
  - Added Preferred Chip Size.
    - Only used by AI:Base, AI:Modnar, AI:Rookie, and AI:RolePlay.
- Added Auto-Flag option: Clear Flag Color.


Last Release:
- Added an Auto-Flag option acting when a new system is scouted.
  - Set a Flag function of Planet Type.
  - Or set a Flag function of Planet Environment.
  - Or set a Flag function of Planet Ressources.
  - Or set a Flag function of Colony Ship Technologies.
  - Pressing "Home" will run the auto-flag to the selected planet flags.
  - Pressing "Alt"+"Home"  will run the auto-flag to all scouted planets flags.
- Up to 4 flags are now available!
  - May be not very useful, but I had fun adding them! ;-)
  - Select Left-Right with "Ctrl".
  - Select Top-Bottom with "Shift".

Fixes:
- Fixed second Map Flag showing black instead of not showing.
- Fixed text on buttons some time not following the modifier keys.
- Precursor Relic event:
  - AIs and Player have now the same view of the new created planets.
    - AIs where accidentally "cheating", to be even: now the player too!
  - Player is always notified of the planet creation.

Others: Partially Disabled Profiles Manager:
- It was not updated to the new menu.
- It was not updated for the new options
- And it may already be broken!
- Almost everything is now more easily available from the GUI.
  - Every save file is a profile that can be loaded!
  - You can easily change the parameters in game...
  - The restart function works better!
  - Etc...
- But if you miss some of its features: Just ask!
- I will slowly continue to totally remove it!
