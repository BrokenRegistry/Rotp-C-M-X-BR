Added option to change AI in game, On the Races/species'abilities-panel:
  - Click on the AI Button and select the new AI.
  - Available for the player and the aliens.

Tested on short game only, I guess that u/pizza-knight who requested this feature and u/dweller_below who seconded it may want to try it more intensively...
  - It change the option value and reinitialize the AI variables, those that are reinitialized when reloading a game; then it should be safe.

Added option to avoid Artifact planets being too close to Home Worlds.
	- this should help u/paablo in his ultimate symmetrical restart challenge!
