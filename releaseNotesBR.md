This version contains many changes and does not identify itself as a fusion mod, but more as a Beta version.
I'm quite confident it works well, but we are never too cautious. Please test it and don't hesitate to comment the new features.

Here are the minor changes:
Galaxy setup panel:
- Fixed lonely Orion in Galaxy preview. (When opponents are maxed out)
- Added Companions worlds in Galaxy preview.
- Added original moo small galaxy size: named it Micro = 24 stars.
- Added Dynamic Galaxy size, proportional to number of opponents and preferred number of stars per empire.
- Mixed Restart button with start button (ctrl+Start).

Race setup panel:
- Ship set: Fixed race keeping the last player prefered chip set.
Race diplomacy panel:
- Fixed overlaping Leader text in Race diplomacy panel. (Adaptive font) 

Here are the major changes:
All the settings are now saved in the game files, and are also saved as individual files:
- Last.options for the last gui settings. Saved when you exit the setup panel.
- Game.options for the last played game settings. Saved when a game is started or loaded.
- User.options for your preffered settings.
You can load them in all setup panels. To avoid adding too many button, they are accessible thru the use of the "Shift" and "Control" keys. The buttons will display the active features.
