New Fixes:
- PopUp selection list: "Cancel" will work again!

- Fixed Bombing auto firing the turn following a "Fire all weapon".
- Fixed base setting auto colonize and auto bombard not being saved.
- Governor panel: Fixed ugly html text on Mac.
- If no flags, only show one black flag.
- Fixed Missiles not reaching planet.
  - It was a bug that has probably always been there! The distance to unlock the fire button was calculated according to ship movement rules (Diagonal movement = 1). But missiles follow another rule! (Diagonal movement = sqrt(2)). When ships are on the side of the screen, their distance to the planet is 6, but for missiles, this distance is ~7.2. Since the merculite missile range is 6 (+0.7 attack range)... You were allowed to fire, but the missiles run out of fuel before reaching the target and are destroyed!
  - The fix only unlocks the button when the missiles are really in range.
