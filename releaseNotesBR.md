Added ability to customize player race and randomize Alien races.

A cost is associated with each parameter to help balance the process, but no limit is set.
Any suggestion to improve this cost balance is welcome.
Randomization is available: You select a total cost target and standard deviation that will apply to each parameter. Statistically, the resulting cost should be +/- 12 sigma 95% of the time.
In the "Option MOD B" GUI, you can also set the opponents to be randomized. A standard deviation of "0" means identical alien races, and as sigma increases, the difference between the races increases. With extreme standard deviations, the settings will rarely be average!

And updated to last Xilmi changes
