Only a little one:

- Click on settings with list <= 4 options will pop-up the list selection box.
  - The min list size value can be set in Global Mod Option.
  - The pop-up list can be disabled.
  - The pop-up list can be forced by "Ctrl"-Click
- Galaxy menu:
  - Number of opponents:
    - Added Shift & Ctrl multiple increments.
  - Dynamic Galaxy size:
    - The "Dynamic stars per empire" is now independent from "preferred stars per empire".
  - AI Selection: Selection panel on click. (always)
- Some little fixes:
  - BitmapGalaxy not selected: Fixed FileName box not totally hidden.
  - Fixed Fusion Font size being wrong sometime.
- FeedBack needed...
  - Merged "Advanced Options", "Mod A Options" & "Mod B Options" to a single panel with a common decription box in the bottom.
  - Merged options are available with "Shift-Click" on "Advanced Options".
    - Should these merged options be classified differently?
    - Should I assign these merged options directly to "Advanced Options" and remove "Mod A & B"?
  - Merged options are available in Game with "Ctrl-o" in galaxy map.
    - This menu change the game options, but not all changes affect the game...(You won't be able to change the galaxy!)
