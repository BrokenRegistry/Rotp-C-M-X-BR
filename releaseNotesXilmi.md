  - AI follows a more adaptive research-strategy in the expansion phase.
  - Fixed an issue where in certain cases the AI accidentally knew whether a system was colonized or not when it shouldn't be able to know it.
  - Fixed an issue where the governor wouldn't realize that planets became colonizable after the event that turns uncolonizable planets into colonizable ones.
  - Reworked diplomatic decision-making of Fusion-AI. It should be a lot more aggressive and also try to stop empires that are getting too strong.
