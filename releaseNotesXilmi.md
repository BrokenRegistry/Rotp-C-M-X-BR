## What's New

- Instead of a static 100% score-bonus for being able to kill at least one ship in an enemy-stack, the score is now divided by the hitpoints of the first ship of the stack if not at least one ship can be killed.
This shall help prevent the AI from shooting at big tanky ships that will just retreat once their health drops too far instead of attempting to secure kills on smaller ships.
