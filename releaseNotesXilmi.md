## What's New

2024.06.11 (Xilmi)
- Building scouts now has a higher priority than building colony-ships.
- Modified frequency and limited amount of scout-production to be more feasible even with a huge amount of unscouted systems around.
- Removed a restriction that prevented the AI from bolstering the population of their fresh colonies during a war.
- AI will stop spamming colony-ships when it sees more enemy combat-ships flying around than it has own combat-ships even when there's huge amounts of uncolonized systems.
