## What'New

2022.09.21 (Xilmi)
  - Fixed a crash reportet by /u/Thor1Noak that could occur when the AI wanted to check the range of their current colonizer during diplomatic negotiations, while only having a huge colonizer-design but now no longer wanting a huge design for colonizers but hasn't had the chance to design a new non-huge colony-ship yet because diplomacy is processed before ship-designing!
  - Changed e-mail-address for the bug-report-prompt to my own.
