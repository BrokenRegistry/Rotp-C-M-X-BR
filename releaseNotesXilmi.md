- Combat-AI now checks the safety of a path towards enemy ships and will avoid moving through the attack-range of enemies that would destroy them.
- Fixed an issue that made the AI consider their own missile-boats as worthless due to a recent change about not being afraid from enemy-missile-boats when they haven't attacked yet.
