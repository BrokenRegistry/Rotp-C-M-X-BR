  - Introduced new AI-type: Hybrid. Hybrid-AI is based on Fusion-AI but uses the same Diplomacy- and Espionage-logic as Rookie-AI.
  - Planets initially spawned as fertile were lacking the associated size-increase. This is fixed now.
  - Fixed that confirming a design after using Auto would change the icon of the design.
  - Fixed that Incidents meant exclusively for the Roleplay-AI were also taken into consideration by other AI-types.
  - Fusion-AI will now retreat from enemy colonies it can't do damage to even if their fleet would survive aswell. This is to prevent useless losses if one stack has auto-repair but the colony would target another other.
