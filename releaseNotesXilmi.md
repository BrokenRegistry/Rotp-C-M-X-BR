  - Halfed the numner of systems for the biggest possible map-size. I wanted to do more trial&error to see what the biggest is that I could go but I couldn't be bothered to sit another several minutes through galaxy-creation-time.
  - Fixed polish translation of Deuterium Fuel Cells to be the same as the translation of Iridium Fuel Cells.
  - Colonies now always produce at least 0.1 income in order to prevent weird effects resulting from zero or negative income. This fixes an exploit reported by /u/Mjoelnir77
