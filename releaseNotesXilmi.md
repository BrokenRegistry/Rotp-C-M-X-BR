- Fixed an issue where the AI didn't consider that missile-bases stop dealing damage when all population of a planet is killed. This lead to the AI not daring to attack planets with missile-bases when they only had biological weapons.
- When tech-stealing is disabled, the AI will no longer consider using a security-tax.
- Removed the "smart" logic that handles pop-transportation differently based on richness. Tests showed that treating each planet the same in this regard leads to an overall faster empire-growth of 25% for a rich-homeworld-start.
