## What's New

2022.10.08 (Xilmi)
  - Fixed a bug that caused scatter-pack-missiles doing way less damage than expected during orbital-bombardment. Preview was correct already but actual execution wasn't!
  - Fixed a crash that could occur when autoresolving combats that included missile-bases.
  - During combat AI stacks will now avoid triggering automatic reactive fire of enemy stacks with higher initiative when they can outrange them.
  - During combat target selection of AI will now double the preference of attacking an enemy stack, when it should be able to kill at least one ship in the stack.
