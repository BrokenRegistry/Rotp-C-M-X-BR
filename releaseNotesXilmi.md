## What'New

  - Fixed a rare issue that could cause the governor to forget it was supposed to be building ships.
  - Fixed that the bombardment-preview would display too high of a kill-count when the attack-level exceeded 10.
  - AI no longer tries to reinvade rebelling colonies when they are under siege by their enemies.
  - AI now uses actual travel-turns for the scoring of where to send their ships. Previously this was extrapolated by distance:speed with a modifier for nebulae. This change likely will increase AI-processing-time on big maps but should help the AI to make better decisions when nebulae are involved.
