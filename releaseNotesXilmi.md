## What's New

2022.12.21 (Xilmi)
  - When using the "Use AI to handle transports"-governor-option the "Don't send from rich/artifact planets"-option will now be considered.
  - Fixed an issue where colonies would reduce eco-spending to clean after having manually set it to something higher with governor disabled.
  - Right-clicking the text right of the eco-slider with governor disabled will now only put the maximum amount required to it instead of building reserve.
