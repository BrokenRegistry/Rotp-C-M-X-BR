## What's New

2022.10.14 (Xilmi)
  - Fixed an issue where the report of how many transports were destroyed it would show the number of transports that the defending fleet potentially could have destroyed instead of the actual number.
  - Fixed an issue whith Autoplay being enacted at the start of the game before the views were updated which led to not taking distances into consideration.
  - When sending a colony-ship to unexplored systems the AI will now double the value of yellow stars and multiply the value of orange and red stars by 1.5.
  - AI will no longer send scouts to systems it has already send a colony-ship to.
  - AI will be more efficient with its scouts by giving a higher priority to targets closer to existing scouts.
  - When loading a save-game there's now a validity check for fleets that eliminates fleets with negative amounts of ships. This is a work-around for an issue reported by /u/Thor1noak. Unfortunately the cause of of the underlying bug could not be determined from the save-game.
