## What'New

2022.09.18 (Xilmi)
  - Removed AI: Unfair and added two new AI's instead: AI: Fun and AI: Character. The diplomatic behaviour of AI: Fusion has also been reworked.
  - AI: Fusion: While the race still has some impact on aggression-level, it is now significantly less aggressive for all races and more about playing safe.
  - AI: Character is roughly similar to how Fusion-AI used to work a while back and takes leader-personality into account for how aggressive it should be. Pick this option for getting the experience clostest to how it played before this update.
  - AI: Fun is meant to provide a fun challenge with comparable difficulty across different playthroughs rather than having extreme variance from one game to another. I don't want to spoil yet how exactly it works as I want some unbiased feedback. But I promise that it neither cheats nor is aware of the player to do so. This is now also the default for new games.
  - Random-options for AI have been changed accordingly. Instead of "Random" and "Random+" there now are:
  - AI: Random - Chooses a random AI out of all other AIs.
  - AI: R.Basic - Randomly chooses one of Base, Modnar or Rookie.
  - AI: R.Xilmi - Randomly chooses one of Roleplay, Hybrid, Fun, Character or Fusion.
  - AI: R.no relat - Randomly chooses on of the AIs that don't use relationship for decision-making, which are: Fun, Character and Fusion.
  - The impact of tech-level to both the power-graph and AI's consideration of other's power is now linked to how miniaturization works. This means getting new techs in early-game will have a much lower impact on the power-graph.
  - Fixed an issue that didn't take how far the mouse's scrolling wheel was spun into consideration of how far to scroll in load-game-screen. This issue exists at many places throughout the game that all need fixing. But fixing it for loading-screen was most important due to how much of a nuisance it was to scroll down to a turn-1 save if you have a lot of auto-saves.
  - Fixed that altering build-limit would only call governor when altered from colonies-screen.
  - Fixed governor overspending in ecology under certain circumstances.
  - AI now takes initiative into account when considering whether a speed-disadvantge will lead to dealing less damage.
  - Fixed an issue that prevented AI from attacking the Orion-guardian.
