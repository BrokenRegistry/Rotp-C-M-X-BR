 - AI now identifies scouts in the ship-sending-method by exclusion rather than the isScout-flag.
This prevents an issue that after toggling on autoplay in an ongoing match ships designed by the player would falsely be identified as scouts and thus not be moved like other fleets.

  - AI no longer counting already en-route transports towards what is needed to overwhelm a defending fleet. Doing so has lead to an issue where the AI would keep trickling in transports that would all be shot down.
