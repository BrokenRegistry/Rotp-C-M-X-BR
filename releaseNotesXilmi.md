  - The growth-speed of trade routes has been normalized and is no longer affected by how much one empire likes the other.
  - The racial diplomacy-bonus now impacts trade-route-growth-speed.
  - Removed an unintentional way of Fusion-AI rejecting peace-treaties.
  - Fixed an issue where the AI considered bio-weapons to always do no damage when there was at least one missile base on the strategical map. This makes them way stronger in mid-game-bio-weapon-elimination-wars.
  - Fixed an issue where the AI would always try and sometimes fail to find an alternative target for a fleet too small take on an enemy siege-fleet. This issue was especially problematic when they were outranged. And this fix should make the AI much better at defending.
  - During war AI will only use their own colonies as gatherpoints.
